# Discovery Children's Centre: Snack Menu Project

This is a project I completed for the largest daycare centre in Canada: Discovery Children's Centre (DCC) using SQL, Tableau, and Excel. <b> This project saved the company 20% of food costs and $5,000 in food waste monthly.</b> This project is focused on the daycares snack menu, exploring the most and least popular snack combinations, how often children eat the snack provided, and if they don't, why not?

## Tasks

The stakeholder of this project wanted to re-define the centre's snack menu after realizing how much money and food had been wasted over the course of 2022. We decided to break the project into three parts: 
<ol type= "1">
<li>Explore how often the children at DCC eat the snack provided.</li>
<li>Explore the amount of "likes" vs. "dislikes" towards each current snack combination.</li>
<li>Try new snack combinations in place of the least favoured and re-analyze.</li>
</ol>
Parts 1 and 2 were both completed in September 2022. Part 3 was completed in December 2022.


## Parts 1 and 2

Stakeholder Questions to be Answered:
<ol type= "1">
<li>How often do the children at the centre eat the snack provided? Results based on which room they are in, and their age.</li>
<li>Which snack combinations are the least and most favoured by the children?</li>
</ol>

I started parts 1 and 2 by creating a questionnaire to distribute to the children in the centre. Which can be viewed here. I was able to achieve a 97% confidence level with a 1% margin of error with the daycares population of 311 children. I entered the results of the questionnaires into Excel, resulting in a dataset which can be viewed here. I then queried the data set in SQL, and created dashboards for the stakeholder.

## Part 3

After obtaining the results of parts 1 and 2 I was able to identify the least favoured snack combinations and replace them with new combinations, which were more cost effective. We tested the new combinations in place of the least favoured combinations for ~3 months. I then created a new questionnaire to re-evaluate how often the children eat the snack with these new combinations, and which were the most and least favoured! After entering the results into Excel I used SQL to query my new dataset, and created a final <a href= "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyle4763/viz/DCCSnackMenuProjectPart3/Dashboard1">dashboard</a> for my stakeholder!

## Data Used

The dataset is from <a href= "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">Our World in Data</a>. It has data from December 2019 to March 2021. I manipulated the data in Excel to contain the columns I wanted to work with.

## Tasks

The goal of this project is to explore COVID-19 Data by performing queries in SQL. Then using those queries to create visualizations in Tableau. I explored data globally and regionally.


## Key Findings

* As of 03/01/2021, there have been 150,574,977 COVID-19 cases in the world. The current world death percentage ~2.11%, meaning there is ~2.11% chance of dying if you contract COVID-19.

* United States has the highest percentage of the population infected amugnst many of the larger countries at ~8.93%. Forcasting to ~19.11% in October of 2021.
* As of 03/01/2021, Europe has the highest death count due to COVID-19 at 1,016,750 people.
* ~3.25% of Canadians reported to be infected wih COVID-19 in 03/01/2021.
